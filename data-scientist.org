][become a Data Scientist]]
** 1. get good at stats, math and machine learning
*** math
**** Math Track of Khan Academy
[[https://www.khanacademy.org/math]]
**** Linear Algebra by MIT OpenCourseware
*** Stats
**** Intro to Statistics by Udacity
**** OpenIntro Statistics
*** ML
**** Machine Learning by Andrew NG(Stanford Online)
**** Practical Machine Learning by John Hopkins (Coursera)
** 2. Learn to code
*** Computer Science Fundamentals
**** CS50X on deX
*** Grasp end-to-end development
**** The things you build will be integrated into other systems.
*** Choose first language
**** Open Source: R, Python, etc.
**** Commercial: SAS, SPSS, etc.
*** Learn Interacively
**** R: DataCamp, try R
**** Python: Codecademy, Google Class
** 3. Understand databases
As a data scientist student, you will ofter work with data in text files.
However, once you enter the industry, a database is almost always used to store data.
It's going to be stored in Mysql, Postgres, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.
** 4. Master data munging, visualization and reporting
*** Data cleaninig and munging
**** WHAT
Data munging is the process of converting one "raw" form into another format for more convenient consumption.
**** TOOLS
Getting and Cleaning data by John Hopinks (Coursera)
*** Data visualization
**** WHAT
Data visualization involves the creation and study of the visual representation of data.
**** TOOLS
ggvis
*** Reporting
**** WHAT
In every data analysis, putting the analysis and the results into a comprehensible report is hte final huradle to tak.
**** TOOLS
ableau
spotfire 
R Markdown
** 5. Level up with Big Data
When you start operating with data at the scale of the web, the fundamental approach and  process of analysis must change.
Most data scientists are working on problems that can't be run on single machines. 
They have large data sets that require distributed processing.
*** hadoop
Hadoop is an open-source software framework for storage and large-scale processing of data-sets on clusters of commodity hardware.
*** Map Reduce
MapReduce is this programming paradigm that allows for massive scalability across the servers in a Hadoop.
*** Spark
Apache Spark is Hadoop's speedy Swiss Army knife. It is a fast-runing data analysis system that provides real-time data processing function to Hadoop.
** 6. Get Expperience, practice and meet fellow data scientists.
Proactice makes perfect..
*** Kaggle 
loin in competitions
*** meetup
meet fellow data scientists
*** have a pet project 
*** Develop your intuition
** 7. Internship, bootcamp or get a job.
The bset way to find out whether you are a true data scientist or not is to take the bull by the horns and to enter the real-life jungle of data-analysis and science with your freshly acquired skill set.
